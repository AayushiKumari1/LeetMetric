## 🧠 How It Works

1. The user enters their **LeetCode username**.  
2. JavaScript validates the input and sends a request to the **LeetCode GraphQL API** via a **proxy** to avoid CORS issues.  
3. The app retrieves:  
   - Total questions (Easy, Medium, Hard)  
   - User’s accepted and total submission stats  
4. The data is dynamically displayed as:  
   - Circular progress charts  
   - Detailed submission cards
